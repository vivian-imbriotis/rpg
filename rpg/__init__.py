"""
A module for making and displaying drifting gratings to the 
screen of a raspberry pi (with the default NOOBS installation
of raspbian) while bypassing the windowing system.

It is best to run this module from the fullscreen terminal,
accessed with Ctrl+Alt+F1 (Ctrl+Alt+F7 returns to the desktop)
because otherwise the X windowing system and this module will
both be attempting to configure the framebuffer.

This module is an object-oriented wrapper for the 
_rpigratings module, which is implemented in C for 
performance.
